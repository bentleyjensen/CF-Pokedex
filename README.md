# Career Foundry Pokedex

This is Achievement 1 for the Full Stack Immersion course from CareerFoundry.com.

It's a basic pokedex, fetching pokemon from the public [pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/). As of this writing, it only shows an image, the pokemon's height, and the types of the pokemon, though I hope to expand this later.

## This project's features include:
* Fetching data from an external API
* Custom CSS animation
* A UI Library (Bootstrap 5)
* Responsive grid, components, and images
* A loading spinner
* Modals, including a confirm/cancel modal
* Hosted (via github pages)
* Support for chrome, firefox, safari, and IE11+
* minified JS & CSS for production
* Linting with ESLint and StyleLint

The exercises in the course introduced jQuery, but I determined this app simple enough that the additional load of including the library wasn't worth it.
